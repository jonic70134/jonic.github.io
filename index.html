        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p><img src="img/mypic.jpg" alt="avatar">Originally from Taiwan, now I'm web UI designer. When I in college, It enlightened me about the field, but seriously to say, I was learn about 2D and 3D animation, Flash were major about web design. Later, I autonomous learning HTML / CSS, because WordPress - This blog CMS. That build by PHP,so that made me knew some concept of the programmable logic.<br><br>First job, I made official website by Flash. But I was the only one site maneger and bulider. So I had a difficlult to start. First I use Google search engine to find some hosting provider, Registered the domain name, set the DNS direction, Finaly, I can build website. This experience let me know some skill to manage entire website, not just only build UI.<br><br>Second job was develop by project as the main, sometimes use the CMS, sometimes we had to customize. and I need to communicate with engineers. but I also had to do project manager and customer contact work, understanding the projects progress and customer needs. At the same time, I need to know about CMS like Drupal, Wordpress, Joomla..etc., they had mature system architecture, sometimes I just want to change the style a little, but it must be carefully, otherwise, a small change will affects everything. So, not just only my own work, but also took into account the ease of maintenance.<br><br>And now my work is focus on the UI architecture and SEO issue. Because my company has a global website, they have similar page, only a few different. So I was learned SASS to construct the entire UI architecture, and learned GIT to manage code version for co-work with my UI team and other programmers.use microdata for SEO potimiztion.<br><br>These experience made me easy to communicate with team. But in the past and now, there were no senior UI/UX designer to lead me, almost I took it all. So I lack some experience to solve problem relatively.Now I learn about JS / jQuery、SEO Optimization,HTML5/CSS3 and Responsive Web Design related fields by myself, hoping I can advance my skills and gain more experience, to become a good UI designer.</p>
